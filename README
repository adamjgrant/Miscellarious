Long before there was Pinterest, I had created this fun little app to write things on post it notes or post memes with little image codes.
I got very close to finishing this all on my local machine when it was stolen. I only had what I had uploaded to my server a month before.

I'm ready to revive this :)

**How Miscellarious Works**

+ Either go to any room by clicking on the category at the bottom of a post-it or create a room with the "New" stack. 
You'll have a room at [sitename.com]/yourroomhere.
+ Create a post-it and type in whatever you want or use a <strong>short code</strong> like "img:troll" or "->" to post one of our predefined images.
+ You can also post youtube videos by just pasting in the url.
